# Grad-School-Admission-Rate
This project uses **Multiple Regression Analysis** to predict the chance of admission for any student in a graduate school and assigns a probability score of getting the admit based on criterion of GRE score, and undergrad CGPA.

### Libraries
**Numpy** and **Pandas** are used to get the required structure of the dataset.

**Scikit-learn** models are deployed to TRAIN and TEST the data in this analysis.
